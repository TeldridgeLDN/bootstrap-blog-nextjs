This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Background

My wish is to be able to create a blog in Next JS that requires minimum effort to spin up. Each time I wanted to create a new blog I would have to set up dependencies and organise the file structure to how i wanted it. This script bootstraps and automates the setup process saving considerable time.

This script was created to solve a particular need I had. That is not to say it will fit everyone need. But it will provide a scaffold for creating a blog using Next.js which can then be modified and styled according to one's need.


## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Git: [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation
#### 1. Clone the Repository:

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
```
Replace your username and your-repository-name with your GitHub username and repository name, respectively.

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd your-repository-name
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
#### 4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
